# Haskell Fractals
Currently a simple program which creats pretty shapes in svg format which can be rendered by 
most browsers.

Core code for generating the svg was found [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2711002/image-drawing-library-for-haskell)
and inspired me in its simplicty.

## Sample images:
