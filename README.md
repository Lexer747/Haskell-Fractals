# Haskell Fractals
Currently a simple program which creates pretty shapes in svg format which can be rendered by 
most browsers.

Core code for generating the svg was found [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2711002/image-drawing-library-for-haskell)
and inspired me in its simplicty.

## Sample images:

Simple bounding box demonstration:

![BoundingBox](https://cdn.rawgit.com/Lexer747/Haskell-Fractals/ae0c3551/svg/BoundingBox_Demo.svg)

The blue rectangle is created using affine transformations then the grey rectangle is produce by finding the bouding box of the shape.
